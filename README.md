evolving_personality
====================
Evolving Personality uses the myers-briggs test to examine the way that our personalities change over time.
Upon signup, the whole test is administered, and counts are taken for E, I, S, N, T, F, J, and P.
These are then represented graphically, in multiple ways. 
Every day thereafter, 10 random questions are asked, and answered. And those answers are updated, and shown on the graph.
